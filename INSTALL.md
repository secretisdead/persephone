# Install

- Make sure you have Git installed.
- Make sure you have Python 3.5+ installed.
- Download the install script for [Linux/Mac](persephone_install.virtualenv.sh) or [Windows](persephone_install.virtualenv.cmd) and run it.
- Follow the installation prompts.
- Edit the config files to customize your instance.
- Database stuff will try to install the first time the site is accessed, so you can change what database is being pointed at in the config (and all the db prefixes of each package in their configs) before anything is created.

I recently did a pretty comprehensive write-up for an install from scratch on Debian 9 [here](https://gist.github.com/secretisdead/ddfe1d0d338fa38dc58b84e38da3c096).

Another write-up for an install from scratch on Debian 10 [here](https://gist.github.com/secretisdead/f21b88ddbd5d15ff3fe9f786a40ae972)

A short document with the differences between Debian 10 and Debian 11 [here](https://gist.github.com/secretisdead/f30c84c9dedc6152d688a1e948eb58ed)
